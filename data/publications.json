    "abstract": "Many research efforts are being spent to discover predictive markers of seizures, which would allow to build forecasting systems that could mitigate the risk of injuries and clinical complications in epileptic patients. Although electroencephalography (EEG) is the most widely used tool to monitor abnormal brain electrical activity, no commercial devices can reliably anticipate seizures from EEG signal analysis at present. Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence, particularly deep learning algorithms, show promise in enhancing EEG classifier forecasting accuracy by automatically extracting relevant spatio-temporal features from EEG recordings. In this study, we systematically compare the predictive accuracy of two leading deep learning architectures: recurrent models based on Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). To this aim, we consider a data set of long-term, continuous multi-channel EEG recordings collected from 29 epileptic patients, and we evaluate the performance of both architectures in predicting seizure occurrences up to 30 minutes in advance.",

    "title": "A systematic review of cross-patient approaches for EEG epileptic seizure prediction",
    "authors": "S. Shafiezadeh, G.M. Duma, M. Pozza, A. Testolin",
    "abstract": "Objective: Seizure prediction could greatly improve the quality of life of people suffering from epilepsy. Modern prediction systems leverage artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to automatically analyze neurophysiological data, most commonly the electroencephalogram (EEG), in order to anticipate upcoming epileptic events. However, the performance of these systems is normally assessed using randomized splitting methods, which can suffer from data leakage and thus result in an optimistic evaluation. In this review, we systematically surveyed the available scientific literature looking for research approaches that adopted more stringent assessment methods based on patient-independent testing. Approach: We queried three scientific databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science), focusing on AI techniques based on non-invasive EEG recorded from human subjects. We first summarize a standardized signal processing pipeline that could be deployed for the development and testing of cross-patient seizure prediction systems. We then analyze the research work that meets our selection criteria. Main results: 21 articles adopted patient-independent validation methods, constituting only 4% of the published work in the entire field of epileptic seizure prediction. Among eligible articles, the most common approach to deal with cross-patient scenarios was based on source domain adaptation techniques, which allow to fine-tune the predictive model on a limited set of data recorded from a set of independent target patients. Significance: Overall, our review indicates that epileptic seizure prediction remains an extremely challenging problem and significant research efforts are still needed to develop automated systems that can be deployed in realistic clinical settings. Our review protocol is based on the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis protocols 2020 guidelines for conducting systematic reviews, considering NHLBI and ROBIS tools to mitigate the risk of bias, and it was pre-registered in PROSPERO (registration number: CRD4202452317).",

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence Methods and Digital Intervention Strategies for Predicting and Managing Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Exacerbations: An Umbrella Review",
    "authors": "M. Pozza, N. Navarin, S. Vangelis, S. Gabrielli",
    "abstract": "Background: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a major global health burden in which acute exacerbations accelerate progression and increase hospitalizations. Emerging technologies, such as wearable biosensors, artificial intelligence (AI), and digital health tools, enable more proactive disease management. Objectives: This umbrella review synthesized evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses on (1) AI-driven prediction of COPD exacerbations using low-cost wearable biosignals, and (2) the effectiveness of digital health interventions on disease management, quality of life, and medication adherence. Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science (2015–2025) identified eligible reviews. Methodological quality was assessed using AMSTAR-2, and study overlap was quantified with the Corrected Covered Area (CCA). A narrative synthesis was conducted across two research questions. Protocol registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251164450). Results: Twenty-seven reviews met the inclusion criteria. AI models demonstrated promising internal predictive accuracy but lacked external validation and clinical integration. Digital health interventions, such as mHealth applications and telerehabilitation, showed small to moderate improvements in quality of life and physical function. Reported effects varied considerably (OR = 0.20–2.37; I2 = 0–94%), indicating substantial heterogeneity across studies. Evidence for improvements in medication adherence and exacerbation reduction was inconsistent, and most included reviews were rated “Low” or “Critically Low” in methodological quality, limiting the generalizability of findings. Conclusions: AI and digital tools show strong promise for proactive COPD management, particularly through wearable-derived biosignals, outperforming traditional static assessments. However, their clinical readiness remains limited due to small-scale studies, interpretability challenges, inconsistent outcome measures, and a lack of external validation. To support real-world translation and regulatory adoption, future research must prioritize large-scale, rigorous, and equitable studies with standardized methodologies and robust generalizability testing.",
